# Python for Data Science: Session 3 - Object-Oriented Programming

**Description**  
This notebook provides an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, specifically for data science applications. The notebook covers core OOP principles such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Abstraction and Inheritance
- Polymorphism and Encapsulation

These concepts are explained in the context of data science programming paradigms.
