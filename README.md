## Contents

### 1. **Lambda and Map**
   - Introduction to **lambda functions** in Python.
   - How to use the **map()** function for applying a function to all items in an iterable.
   - Practical examples demonstrating efficient transformations of data using `lambda` and `map`.

---

### 2. **Series**
   - Element-wise operations.
   - String manipulations.
   - Aggregations and statistical methods.

---

### 3. **Advanced Data Manipulation**
   - Working with pandas **DataFrames** at an advanced level:
     - Grouping data with `groupby` for summaries and transformations.
     - Applying custom functions to DataFrames or groups.
     - Sorting and indexing for efficient data querying.
   - Combining and reshaping datasets:
     - Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames.
     - Pivoting and melting data for reshaping purposes.

---

### 4. **Handling Missing Data and Data Transformation**
   - Techniques to manage missing data:
     - Filling missing values using methods like `fillna`, `ffill`, `bfill`, and `interpolate`.
     - Replacing missing data based on group-level statistics or external mappings.
   - Data transformation:
     - String operations using regex.
     - Extracting and splitting data within columns.
     - Creating new features through mapping and applying functions.
